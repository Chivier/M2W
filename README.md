# M2W Project

## What is M2W?

M2W(mp4 to word) project aims to create a new method to compress special kinds of videos. For example, when you are watching a record video of a lecture, you concern more about what the professor was saying, not how does him look like or something else. M2W aims to provide a full toolchain of transforming between video file and text file freely.
